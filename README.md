# ERC20 Wallet Generator and Balance Checker
This is a Wallet generator and balance checker built using React Native and Ethers. This was created for educational purposes only.

This project illustrates that with enough time and computing power anyone will be able to generate a multitude of wallets. Some might even be owned by other individuals. 

Some people might think that the mnemonic phrase system is enough to keep their crypto wallets secure but that is not the case. In the coming future a best practice would be to have multiple wallets in which one can transfer and diversify their holdings, this would be to have a level of protection against this sort of attack. 

I believe that with the rate of advancement of quantum computing reaching the maximum number of 12 word combinations using the 2048 BIP word list can be achieved in a matter of minutes. Now the question would be is there a Web3 provider that can handle that many requests... I guess we'll find out soon enough ( ͡°( ͡° ͜ʖ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°) ͡°).

## Start-Up
To start up the expo server first run:
```bash
npm install
```
then make sure you add your own web3 provider to generator.ts

After that you can run
```bash
expo start
```
